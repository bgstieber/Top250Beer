# Landing page for the top 250 beer .csv

Data on top 250 beers as determined by BeerAdvocate. 

Data was taken from http://www.beertrotter.com/beeradvocate-top-250/, which originally had the file saved as an .xlsx (along with other data that isn't necessary for my purpose). I converted to a .csv to make reading a bit easier.
